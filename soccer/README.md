This is a simple Sinatra web app with a MVC model. It has a user and the user can create teams and manage using the CRUD functions.

User will have a name, username and password. The password will need to be authenticated everytime the user logs in to the app.

The user can only use the update and delete functions if the user is the owner of the team.

This app is loaded using the corneal gem which can create the MVC with a few short commands in the terminal after installing the gem
